- **TikTok**: Seeing great engagement with the *Crazy Story* series, especially on TikTok.
- **Interview Clips**: Continuing to test different animation styles and hook strategies.
- **Blue Collar Bloopers / Memes**: Strong performance in terms of views and shares.
- **LinkedIn & Twitter**: Growth has been slow. These platforms favor written content, so a new series tailored for that format will be launched.
- **Facebook**: Growth is currently slow. We anticipate improvement as Instagram picks up. If not, weâ€™ll consider launching a new series specifically optimized for Facebook.
